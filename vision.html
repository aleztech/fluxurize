        We believe the best tools for automation are quiet, focused and honest. No noisy dashboards, no vanity charts, just native experiences that help you understand what your workflows are doing and why.

      <h2 class="section-title">Principles we build with</h2>
      <div class="vision-grid">
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Automation first</h3>
          <p>
            We design for people who live inside tools like n8n and Make every day. The goal is not another dashboard, it is to make automation easier to trust and safer to operate.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Privacy by default</h3>
          <p>
            Connections go directly from your device to your automation platform. No proxy, no external backend that inspects your traffic, no analytics SDK injected into your workflows.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Native experiences</h3>
          <p>
            We favour native iOS experiences that feel fast, offline-friendly and respectful with battery life and bandwidth, instead of thin web wrappers or generic admin panels.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Honest complexity</h3>
          <p>
            Automation is messy by nature. Our job is not to hide that under gradients, but to give you the right level of detail and healthy defaults so you can make better decisions.
          </p>

    <section class="page-section vision-ai">
      <h2 class="section-title">How we think about AI</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        AI should sit next to your workflows, not in front of them. It should make complex states easier to read, spot anomalies earlier and suggest better actions, without taking control away from you.
      </p>
      <div class="vision-grid">
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Assist, don’t replace</h3>
          <p>
            We use AI to summarise runs, flag risky behaviour and highlight what changed, but the final decision stays in your hands as an operator.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Signals, not noise</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of flooding you with notifications, we focus on prioritised signals: what broke, what is slowing down and what might fail next if nothing changes.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Transparent by design</h3>
          <p>
            Any AI feature should be explainable. You should always be able to see the underlying executions, logs or requests that generated a suggestion.

      <h2 class="section-title">Where Fluxurize is going</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Today we start with companions for n8n and Make. Over time, Fluxurize will expand into a small studio of tools around observability, safety and applied intelligence for automation.
      </p>
      <div class="roadmap-grid">
        <article class="roadmap-card">
          <h3>Better observability</h3>
          <p>
            Clearer health views for workflows and scenarios, with trends over time instead of snapshots that expire as soon as you close the app.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="roadmap-card">
          <h3>Safer operations</h3>
          <p>
            Guardrails for high-impact automations, with better context before you trigger or pause something from your phone.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="roadmap-card">
          <h3>Applied intelligence</h3>
          <p>
            Narrow, opinionated AI features that understand your automation graph and help you spot issues before they turn into incidents.
