      <p class="page-lead">
        We build focused, fast and opinionated tools for teams who live in automation. No dashboards full of noise, no bloated layers, just native iOS apps that help you understand what your workflows are doing, why they behave the way they do and what needs your attention.

      <h2 class="section-title">Principles we build with</h2>
      <div class="vision-grid">
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Automation first</h3>
          <p>
            We design for people who work daily inside platforms like n8n and Make. The goal is not another dashboard, it is giving you clarity, trust and real control over your automation system.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Privacy by default</h3>
          <p>
            All connections happen directly between your device and your automation platform. No proxy, no analytics SDKs, no inspection of your traffic. Credentials stay in your Keychain.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Native experiences</h3>
          <p>
            We build real native iOS apps with smooth navigation, instant feedback and efficient battery and bandwidth usage. Not web wrappers, not generic panels.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Honest complexity</h3>
          <p>
            Automation is naturally complex. Our job is to show the right level of detail without overwhelming you, and give you safe defaults so you can act fast and confidently.
          </p>

    <section class="page-section vision-ai">
      <h2 class="section-title">How we think about AI</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        AI should sit next to your workflows, not in front of them. It should make complex states easier to read, spot anomalies earlier and suggest better actions, without taking control away from you.
      </p>
      <div class="vision-grid">
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Assist, don’t replace</h3>
          <p>
            AI highlights anomalies, summarises runs and flags changes, but the final decision stays in your hands as the operator.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Signals, not noise</h3>
          <p>
            We surface only the signals that matter, such as what broke, what slowed down and what might fail next, without generating irrelevant noise.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="vision-card">
          <h3>Transparent by design</h3>
          <p>
            Every AI suggestion should be explainable. You always have access to the underlying logs, requests or executions that triggered a recommendation.

      <h2 class="section-title">Where Fluxurize is going</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Today we start with companions for n8n and Make. Over time, Fluxurize will expand into a small studio of tools built around observability, safety and applied intelligence for automation.
      </p>
      <div class="roadmap-grid">
        <article class="roadmap-card">
          <h3>Better observability</h3>
          <p>
            Clearer health views for workflows and scenarios, with trends over time instead of snapshots that disappear as soon as you close the app.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="roadmap-card">
          <h3>Safer operations</h3>
          <p>
            Guardrails for high-impact automations, with better context before you trigger or pause something from your phone.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="roadmap-card">
          <h3>Applied intelligence</h3>
          <p>
            Narrow, opinionated AI features that understand your automation graph and help you detect issues before they turn into incidents.
