    <h1>Privacy Policy for Companion for n8n</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: March 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the iOS application <strong>Companion for n8n</strong>
      (the “App”), published by <strong>Fluxurize</strong>.
      Companion for n8n is an independent client and is not affiliated with, endorsed by,
      or associated with n8n GmbH.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data we collect</h2>
    <p>
      Fluxurize does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal data from your use of the App.
      We do not use analytics, tracking SDKs, advertising frameworks, or remote logging tools.
      No user accounts are created and no information is sent to Fluxurize servers.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data stored on your device</h2>
    <p>
      The App stores information locally on your device in order to function:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configured n8n instance URLs</li>
      <li>Authentication data such as API keys, stored securely using Apple Keychain</li>
      <li>Your UI preferences, favorites and similar local settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data stays on your device and is only transmitted to the n8n instance that
      <strong>you</strong> configure. Fluxurize does not have access to this data.
      If you use iCloud backups, Apple may include this data in your device backups in
      accordance with your iOS settings.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Connections to your n8n instance</h2>
    <p>
      The App communicates directly with the n8n server endpoint that you provide.
      You are responsible for the configuration and security of that server.
      Fluxurize does not operate, host or manage your n8n instance.
    </p>

    <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      The App offers an optional Pro version via In-App Purchases or subscriptions.
      All payments are processed securely by Apple through StoreKit and the App Store.
      Fluxurize does not receive or store your payment card details.
      Information about your purchase (for example, whether you are entitled to Pro features)
      is stored locally on your device using Apple’s signed receipts.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under the age required by local law.
      We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      The latest version will always be available within the App and on our website.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
